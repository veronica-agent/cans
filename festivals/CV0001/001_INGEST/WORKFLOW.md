# Ingest Phase Workflow

This document guides the agent through the ingest phase. Follow these steps in order, completing each checkpoint before proceeding.

---

## Step 1: GATHER — Copy All Requirement Artifacts into input_specs/

**Goal:** Ensure every piece of requirement material the user already has is present in `input_specs/` before any reading or analysis begins.

**Actions:**
1. Ask the user (or check the festival context) what requirement artifacts exist: intents, notes, structured specs, prior planning text, chat history summaries, docs, screenshots, or any other relevant material
2. Copy or transcribe each artifact into `input_specs/` — one file per source, named descriptively (e.g., `intent-original.md`, `prior-design-notes.md`, `user-chat-summary.md`)
3. If the user seeded content at festival creation time, confirm it is present in `input_specs/` and correctly named
4. List the files now in `input_specs/` and confirm with the user that nothing is missing before proceeding

**Output:** All available requirement artifacts present in `input_specs/`

**Checkpoint:** None — proceed to Step 2

---

## Step 2: READ — Understand All Input

**Goal:** Build comprehensive understanding of what the user has provided.

**Actions:**
1. List all files in `input_specs/`
2. Read each file completely — do not skim
3. Identify: What is the user trying to accomplish? What problem are they solving?
4. Note any questions or ambiguities

**Output:** Mental model of the user's intent (no document yet)

**Checkpoint:** None — proceed to Step 3

---

## Step 3: EXTRACT — Identify Key Elements

**Goal:** Pull out the essential information that needs to be structured.

**Actions:**
1. Extract festival purpose (end goal, "done" criteria, why it matters)
2. Extract requirements (what needs to happen, acceptance criteria, priorities)
3. Extract constraints (technical, process, timeline)
4. Extract context (prior art, related systems, references)

**Output:** Notes on each element (can be rough)

**Checkpoint:** None — proceed to Step 4

---

## Step 4: STRUCTURE — Produce Output Specs

**Goal:** Transform extracted elements into structured documents.

**Actions:**
1. Create `output_specs/purpose.md` with festival purpose, success criteria, motivation
2. Create `output_specs/requirements.md` with prioritized requirements (P0/P1/P2)
3. Create `output_specs/constraints.md` with technical and process constraints
4. Create `output_specs/context.md` with prior art and key references

**Output:** Four documents in `output_specs/`

**Checkpoint:** None — proceed to Step 5

---

## Step 5: PRESENT — Get User Approval

**Goal:** Verify the structured output captures the user's intent.

**Actions:**
1. Summarize what you've produced (don't dump full documents)
2. Highlight any interpretations you made or questions you have
3. Ask: "Do these specs accurately capture what you want to accomplish?"

**Output:** Summary presented to user

**Checkpoint:** APPROVAL REQUIRED — Wait for user response

---

## Step 6: ITERATE or COMPLETE

**Goal:** Handle user feedback or finalize the phase.

**Actions:**
1. If user rejects: Note feedback, return to Step 4, update specs
2. If user approves: Mark phase complete, note any caveats

**Output:** Phase completion or iteration

**Checkpoint:** None — phase ends
