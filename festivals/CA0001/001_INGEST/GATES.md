# Ingest Phase Gate

This gate verifies the ingest phase achieved its goal and produced approved structured output.

---

## Step 1: PHASE GOAL — Verify Goal Achievement

**Question:** Does the structured output capture the user's intent as specified in the ingest objective?

**Actions:**
1. Re-read PHASE_GOAL.md and compare stated ingest objectives against produced output
2. Verify the structured output faithfully represents the original input meaning
3. Confirm interpretive decisions are documented and justified

**Checkpoint:** APPROVAL REQUIRED — Confirm ingest goal is met

---

## Step 2: COMPLETENESS — Verify All Inputs Processed

**Question:** Were all input specifications processed?

**Actions:**
1. Confirm every file in `input_specs/` was read completely
2. Verify no inputs were overlooked or partially processed
3. Check that ambiguities and questions were noted

**Checkpoint:** APPROVAL REQUIRED — Confirm all inputs processed

---

## Step 3: APPROVAL — Verify User Validated Output

**Question:** Did the user validate the structured output?

**Actions:**
1. Confirm the user reviewed and approved the output specifications
2. Verify any user corrections were incorporated
3. Check that requirements are clear enough for downstream planning

**Checkpoint:** APPROVAL REQUIRED — Confirm user validated output
